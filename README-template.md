### What I learned

From this project, I learned how to connect an existing frontend repo with a backend repo. I also learned how to deploy the end product onto Fly.io using their command line tool. This project was more of an exercise for me to learn how to work with MongoDB using MongooseJS.

### Continued development

Work needs to be done on the frontend, as this application is focused primarily on functionality. Also, currently, this repo is primarily back-end, it is reliant on its front-end repo which can be found [here](https://github.com/DeviantSchemist/fullstackopen_phonebook). Anytime a change is needed in the UI, the front-end repo's code would need to be changed, and then built.  A better deployment pipeline needs to be set up.
